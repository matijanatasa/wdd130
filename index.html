      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>During your days at work things can get heavy at times, right? Or do your 
        clients get bored? What if you had a coworker, assistant or some other employee 
        who is also a professional singer and would very gladly sing a song for you or your 
        clients while doing their job whenever asked? I am a professional singer who happens to 
        learn fast pretty much any job. I can improve your days and your business productivity by 
        lightening up your mood or the mood of your clients so they will seek your services more 
        often. On my site one can insert the job I’m asked to do and the site will show a list of 
        songs that one can select for me to sing while working, otherwise one can let the site choose 
        for them or one can send me a message and I will contact them back.</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is surely employers of any age, I guess they need to be of legal age.
        The fun fact is that it is intended for employers of pretty much all kinds, because I am 
        a fast lerner, precise and willing to work passionately as I love learning new things 
        and of course, singing. I bring with me a lot of value, so I'd look for employers with a 
        righteous mind and full of optimism. Optimism is however optional because I can bring that with me. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Matija Nataša and I’ve been singing since I was six in choirs and everywhere since I were a baby. 
        Many times during my work hours I would start singing and things went smoother. That’s how I thought of making it officially so, 
        that I should be a singing employee! I love learning new things and skills and that’s why I’m a fast learner. I’ve been a singer, 
        a model, an interpreter, a translator, a teacher, an au pair, a shop assistant, a waitress, a hostess and I’ve acquired many skills 
        from courses and life in general. Let me show you what I can do for you and your clients, I’ll work for you for free three days or 
        more to show you my approach.

      <h3>About Music</h3>
      <p>
        “Music is a safe kind of high” said Jimi Hendrix 
 
        “Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life” said the German poet and author Berthold Auerbach. 

        There are a thousand quotes about music, on its importance and value. Good music lightens up out spirits and makes us love life.
